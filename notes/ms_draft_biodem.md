### Introduction

The idea is to use a state and transition model to predict the migration rate of the temperate forest community.

Why is this work important  

We hypothesized that the migration rate of the temperate forest community will occur slowly. We also hypothesized that the demography and the limited dispersal will slowing down the migration rate.

1.**What's limit the ability to predict future vegetation range shift ?**

Most studies use species distribution models to predict impact of climate change on future species distribution range. In most cases, those models are inappropriate to study migration rate because they lead to instantaneous vegetation responses.

- Integrate ecological processes are primordial to evaluate migration rate and predict future range shift.
    - Vegetation = Slow demography, limited dispersion.
    - Biotic interaction could lead to local extinction (e.g strong competitive exclusion at distribution edges).

2.**How the STM approach contribute to fill the gap ? (without explaining the STM)**

- Process-based models models enhance abilities to understand and predict future range shift (Snell 2011).
- Meta-community approach to Process-based models. The STM include several mechanisms ()
- Integrate ecological processes is primordial to study range shift at the edges of species distributions. *Transition to boreal-temperate ecotone*

3.**Why the STM is relevant for the natural system studied?**

### Objectives

1. We want to predict the future distribution of the temperate forest communities at the end of this century with CC.
2. We want to illustrate that the migration rate is slow, generating a time lag between the potential and the realized distribution of the temperate communities (both are at the equilibrium with the climate).
3. According to point 2, we want to highlight which ecological processes (limited dispersion, demography or/and biotic interaction ) are slowing down this migration.

### Description of the method

a. STM with local prevalence (full version) (8 neighbors cells)
b. STM with global prevalence (w/o limited dispersion) (8 neighbors cells pickup randomly accross the landscape)
c. STM at equilibrium (w/o dispersion and demography)
d. SDM (w/o demography, spatial interaction and limited dispersion)

**Analyse the temperate boundary movement**

We use a state transition model to predict the dynamic of the boreal-temperate forests ecotone under climate change. At regional scale, the ecotone is a macro-mosaic covered by three forest cover types: (i) deciduous, (ii) mixed and (iii) coniferous.

 In the present model, each forest type is identified as state which corresponds .

We include a regeneration state to represent post-disturbance stands.  Transition between states are climate-dependant. Transitions between all states are possible except the direct transition between a deciduous and coniferous stand, which requires an intermediate step through state M. Except for the colonization probability, transition probabilities vary with the proportion of coniferous or deciduous found in the  neighborhood to represent dispersal limitations. For instance, the succession rate of a coniferous patch towards a mixed patch (M) depends also on the availability of D and M patches in the landscape.

*Data and calibration*

To calibrate the model, we used an extensive database of a large network of forest permaments plots covering northeast of North America (add extent). Forest survey start in 1970 to 2010 with up to 6 measurements. For each plot measurements, we characterized the composition looking at the species occurrences and compute the total basal area. **Classification based on species composition** If the plot
