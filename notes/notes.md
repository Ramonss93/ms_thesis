1. Renwick, K. M., & Rocca, M. E. (2014). Temporal context affects the observed rate of climate-driven range shifts in tree species, 44–51. http://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12240

Recent efforts to explain the slow rate of tree migration have primarily focused on **dispersal limitation** and **niche-based constraints such as competition and other biotic interactions**. Les auteurs suggèrent de se tourner vers la démographie pour comprendre le mécanisme de migration.

Is some place will exist in the future for secies such as sugar maple ?
Lack of knowledges on the migration rate on latitudinal gradient


we use the term patch to be equivalent to a locality capable of holding a local population or community
Patch dynamic: A perspective that assumes that patches are identical and that each patch is capable of containing populations. Patches may be occupied or unoccupied. Local species diversity is limited by dispersal. Spatial dynamics are dominated by local extinction and colonization
Species-sorting
