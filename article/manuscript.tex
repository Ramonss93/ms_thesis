\section{Introduction}

% What ?
Species distribution models (SDMs) are one of the most popular tool to predict impact of climate change on species geographical range \cite{Iverson2002}.
Predict forest species range shift under climate change is limited as trees are sessile, long-lived and slow to mature \cite{Lenoir2014a} while SDMs based on correlative methods predict instantaneous vegetation responses. Using this approach, forest migration rates are often overestimated (Source).  Integrate ecological processes using process based-model are primordial to improve this prediction \cite{Snell2014a}.  Strong biotic interaction, slow demography and dispersal limitation can conduct to local extinction or prevent species colonization at the leading edge of the species distribution (Source). These ecological mechanisms could limit species spread rate over the forest landscape and could explain why many species are failure to migrate \cite{Zhu2012} and keep pace with the rapidness of climate change \cite{Renwick2014}.

%Why?
The real challenge is to predict if forest species will reach this equilibrium and if not what are the ecological processes (e.g.; demography, biotic interaction) or landscape attributes (e.g.; fragmentation) limiting their spreading.

The inability of species to migrate can increase the tension between the potential and the realized distribution.


Comparing SDM predictions with proccess-based model allow to predict the area mismatch between the extent of suitable habitat and


Forest management and natural disturbance could release this tension and induce rapid shift in species composition at leading edge of biomes transition.
Temerate-boreal forests are forecast to have abrupt change in community composition at the end of this century \cite{Fisichelli2013}.
Such observations have been already made in Quebec. Boucher \textit{et al.}  (2006) et Dupuis \textit{et al.} (20111) shown that the prevalence of broadleaf trees such as maples, paper birch and poplar have increased in the last decades at the boreal-temperate forests transitions \cite{Dupuis2011,Boucher2006}.

In this present study, we investigated the range shift and migration rate of the temperate forest at his transition with the boreal forest using a states and transitions model (STM). We simulated the ecotone dynamic using different variants of the STM on Global Climate Models (GCMs) projections. We compared the STM version outputs to assess which ecological processes - dispersion,  demography, propagule effect and biotic interaction - are limiting or increasing the northward migration of the temperate forest.


\section{Methods}

The temperate-boreal forests ecotone can be seen at the landscape scale as a
macro-mosaic filled by three different forest stand patches; Boreal stand
dominated by coniferous species, Temperate stand dominated by broadleaf
species and finally Mixed stand as a mid-succesionnal patch \cite{Goldblum2010,Fisichelli2013}. In this section, we present how we collected and classified forest plots surveys into these three regional forest biomes and how we extracted and linked environmental data with the plot location. Then, we described the model and the calibration method we used to simulate the dynamic of the boreal-temperate forest ecotone. In the last paragraph, we explained the simulation plan and the STM variants we ran to assess which ecological mechanisms constrains the migration rate of the temperate forest.

\subsection{Forest plot surveys}

Forest permanent plot surveys are extracted from forest inventory databases widely distributed in Eastern North America. This plots network incorporate the Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program in United States (national protocol in place since 1990, Source); Domtar a forest private company in Quebec (Source); the Ministry of Forest, Wildlife and Parks in Quebec (Source); the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry in Ontario (Source); the Ministry of Natural Resources in New-Brunswick (Source).  We collected and standardized basic informations on each plot and individual tree alive including GPS location, species, year of measure, diameter at breast height (>=127mm), sample area and then computed the basal area of each plot. We selected 42,987 plots located at the boreal-temperate ecotone between 57$^{\circ}$W to 96$^{\circ}$W and 25$^{\circ}$N to 52$^{\circ}$N. Only the plots with a annual mean temperate lower than 10$^{\circ}$C was considered. Plot surveys started in 1960 and finished in 2012 by including 2 measurements for 8,439 plots, 3 measurements for 4,609 plots and 1,733 plots with up to 4 measurement. The time interval between plots measurements are not constant among plots. The median time interval is 5 years (n=25,227). Other recurrent intervals are 7 years (n=3,572), 10 years (n=4,182) and 11 years (n=3,239).

% SV: Need to reformulated this paragraph
Each selected plot is classified in three forest stand types (i.e; Boreal, Temperate and Mixedwood) following the species composition (i.e.; species occurence). The temperate community consists of 7 different species - Black cherry, Red maple, Sugar maple, White ash, Black ash, American beech, Ironwood, Basswood - and the boreal community with 8 species - White spruce, Black spruce, Red spruce, Tamarack, Jack pine, Eastern hemlock, Balsam fir, White cedar. If both species types occurs within the plot then the plot is classified as a mixedwood stand type. We kept track on the plots who have been encountered major natural disturbances by classifying them as regeneration when the basal area was lower than 1 m$^2$ par hectare. By using this classification method, we obtained 4,419 transitions and 50,532 none-transitions occurring among all plot measurements (table.\ref{TransMat}).

\subsection{Linking environmental conditions}

% Data used to calibrate the SDM and the STM
 The past-climate was provided by the Natural Resources Canada database covering the entire North-America with a resolution of 10 km$^2$ \cite{McKenney2011}.
We intercepted 18 bioclimatic parameters (\textit{list parameters in SI: https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/projects/3/8}) at each plot location and year of measure. %(Do I need to list them ?)
To limit the inter-annual variability, parameters were aggregated using the average on the last 15 years before the measurement.  \cite{Hengl2014}.

Model projections have been made on 23 Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the fifth IPCC assessment using the worst scenario RCP 8.5 (Source). GCMs outputs were downscaled at 10 km$^2$ by Ouranos, a Consortium on Regional Climatology and Adaptation to Climate Change in Quebec (Source).

% Do I need to tell that I used te three variable downscaled by Ouranos either tmin, tmax and prepcipitation
%We projected the model starting to 2005 until 2095 every 5 year.

\subsection{The states and transitions model approach}

To reproduce and simulate the dynamic of this ecotone, we used a state and
transition model as a patch occupancy model \cite{Leibold2004}. We incorporated  the three different forest stand types as states: Boreal (B), Temperate (T), Mixed (M) (Fig. \ref{fig1}). A forest state is defined as mature stand characterized by a specific species community which is
the result of the local climatic conditions. The disturbance regime is one of the important component of this natural system dynamic \cite{Bergeron2004,Vanderwel2014}; consequently, we added the regeneration state (R, Fig. \ref{fig1}) to represent a post-disturbance stand.

\input{figs/fig1_model.tex}

Among the states, transitions occur by ecological
processes and are formulated in the present model as a transition probability. All transitions between states are possible except the direct transition between a temperate and boreal stand, which requires an intermediate step through the state mixed.

Boreal patch is converted as a mixed patch by colonization rate ($\beta_T$, fig. \ref{fig1}) of temperate species. This colonization rate depends on the proportion of temperate species propagules present in the neighbors ($T+M$) but also the probability of the patch to be none-disturbed ($1 - \epsilon$). Hence, transition of boreal patches toward mixed patches can be formulated as $\beta_T \cdot (T+M) \cdot (1-\epsilon)$. Then, a mixed patch can transfer to a pure temperate patch by competitive exclusion of boreal species ($\theta_T$, Fig. \ref{fig1}). When a disturbance appears on the patch such as fire, wind throw
or insect outbreak, the patch is transferred has a regeneration state. The
disturbed patch can recover from this disturbance to a boreal, temperate or
mixed stand by successional dynamic. Each of those transition probabilities between states are climate-dependant calibrated on two climatic variables: annual precipitation (mm) and annual mean temperature ($^{\circ}$C).

\subsection{Calibration of the transition probabilities}

We estimated each transition probabilities with logistic regression (GLM) on climatic conditions - characterized by annual mean temperature (TP) and the annual precipitation (PP) scaled using the linear and quadratic terms (eq. 1).

\begin{equation}
	logit(\alpha_b) = \alpha_{b0} + \alpha_{b1} \cdot TP + \alpha_{b2} \cdot PP + \alpha_{b3} \cdot TP^2 + \alpha_{b4} \cdot PP^2
\end{equation}

Transition probabilities were fitted simultaneously searching for the global optimum of each function with the simulating annealing method (GenSA package \cite{YangXiang2013}). For each set of parameters converged, we computed the likelihood of each functions using the prevalence and

We selected 12 set of parameters whose converged and had the best likelihood value in order to perform the simulations on each set and evaluate the sensitivity of the model.

% More justification
% Why we choose those climatic variable ? Those climatic variable have been recognized as a good combination to explain the distribution of the boreal forest \cite{Scheffer2012,Goldblum aussi}.

% Mise à l'échelle années pour les transitions


To calibrate the transition probabilities between states based on climate and plot neighbors, we used R (version 3.2.0) and the classification algorithm Random Forest (RandomForest package, version 4.6-10 ) \cite{Liaw2002a}, we incorporated three information types: (1) state transitions observed between plot measurements, (2) the average climate of the 15 years before each measurements for the two climatic variables of interest and finally the (3) the proportion of states available in the neighbors using a SDM (RandomForest) approach as a proxy.

\subsection{Simulations and analysis}

1. How the model is implemented as spatial explicit ? Moore neighbors
Describe the initial simulation landscape and the choice of the resolution


We performed the simulations using 10 several initial landscape, and 12 different sets of parameters. For each parameters set and initial landscape, we ran simulations over the climate predicted by the 23 Global Climate Models (GCM) downscaled at 10 km$^2$ by the Ouranos consortium in clmatology in Quebec. For each of those combinations, we replicated 10 times the simulation in order to take in account the model stochasticty.

%Should I add an isocline representing the probability of 1 (predicted by the STM) to observe temperate forest?

Facultatif. We found that the STM was able to almost reproduce the actual distribution of the temperate forest and boreal forest.
1. Replacement of mixed forests by temperate forest
2. Long term simulations suggest a further but extremely slow colonization of the temperate forest northward

Slow temperate forest demography constrains migration rate more than dispersal limitation. Using the unlimited dispersion version, we predicted that the temperate forest

Spatial interaction prevents the temperate forest to fullfil its predicted niche (SDM) within an ecological timescale.
